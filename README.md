I'm Prashanth and I'm currently in my final year of Computer Science, undergrad at VIT Vellore. I have a huge interest in the field of machine learning, "Deep learning" to be exact and have always been enthralled by the advances made in the field! I have worked on many projects involving deep learning over the past few years and am hoping to sharpen my skills more to work on more difficult projects!

All projects worked on are present in my repositories so feel free to take a look!

Iâ€™m currently working on a Speech Recognition model with neural networks using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries

I'm also currently working as a part-time Data Analyst for an E-Commerce website/company.

How to reach me: Feel free to email me at (prashanth.v1603@gmail.com)
