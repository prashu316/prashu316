## A Small Intro
I'm Prashanth and I'm currently in my first year of Masters in Computer Science at KU Leuven, Belgium. I have a huge interest in the field of machine learning, "Deep learning" to be precise and have always been enthralled by the advances made in the field! I have worked on many projects involving deep learning over the past few years and am hoping to burgeon my skills even further to work on more convoluted projects!

All projects worked on are present in my repositories so feel free to take a look!
